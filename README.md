A repo consisting my side projects done in free time.

Dec 2022
- dumb: 
    The no button shifts to a random position upon clicking, forcing the user to click yes to validate the question. 
- ipa_flashcard: 
    A application for studying IPA symbols, inspired from the flashcard system I used to when studying phonetics in a Linguistics course during 2022 fall semester.

    Two modes: 
    1. Description to IPA
        The user is given a description to a symbol. They then need to select the correct ipa symbol from the chart.
    2. IPA to description
        The user is given a description to a symbol. They then need to select the correct descriptions.
    
    The players can choose which set(s) of IPA symbols they want to include: Pulmonic egressive consonants, Vowels
    (to be added: Non-pulmonic egressive consonants, Diacritics, Tones)
